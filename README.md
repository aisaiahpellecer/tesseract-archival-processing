# [MPF] Archival Processing with Tesseract

## Overview
An experimental approach to streamlining tasks from my tiny desk and a standard scanner.

**Current plan:**

Functional Requirements:
* Iterate and Name PDFs Emailed from Scanner

    * Avoid Iterating over already processed documents.
* Use Tesseract (Open-Source OCR Software) to process the documents and print out-language.


* Apply NLP analysis to validate outputs and generate text similiarity between manually recorded subject headings and OCR processed document.

* Output updated xls of matched documents.

--- Potential ---

* Generate TKinker Gui for easy matching (Showcasing OCR Text and Subject Headings)
